# Single-container build: the FastAPI core serves the API *and* the built
# dashboard, so one image / one URL runs the whole thing. Used by free hosts
# like Render or Hugging Face Spaces (Docker).

# 1) Build the dashboard as a static site.
FROM node:20-slim AS frontend
WORKDIR /app/frontend
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY frontend/ ./
RUN TITAN_STATIC=1 npm run build

# 2) Python image runs the core and serves the static dashboard from frontend/out.
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/requirements.txt backend/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r backend/requirements.txt
COPY backend/ backend/
COPY --from=frontend /app/frontend/out frontend/out

# Auth is OFF by default so the dashboard works out of the box.
# To lock it behind a password LATER, add these as Space variables/secrets
# (no rebuild or code change needed):
#   TITAN_REQUIRE_AUTH = 1
#   TITAN_USERNAME     = <your username>
#   TITAN_PASSWORD     = <your password>
#   TITAN_SECRET       = <any long random string>
# Never bake credentials into the image — always set them as host secrets.

# HF Spaces (Docker) expects the app on port 7860 (matches app_port in README).
# Render and other hosts inject $PORT, which overrides the default below.
EXPOSE 7860
