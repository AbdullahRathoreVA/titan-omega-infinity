# Make.com Automation — Complete From-Zero Setup (Abdullah's Titan Omega)

## ✅ Abdullah's status (reset 2026-07-02 — ALL scenarios deleted, rebuilding from scratch)
Build in this exact order; each section below has the click-by-click steps:
- [ ] **Scenario 1 — Fiverr order email → revenue log** ⭐ FIRST (15 min, instant value)
- [ ] Scenario 2 — daily social posting (LinkedIn/FB/IG/Pinterest) at 9:00 + 18:00
- [ ] Scenario 3 — Gmail customer-care auto-reply (start in DRAFT mode)
- [ ] Scenario 5 — channel stats → HUD sidebar lights up with real numbers
- [ ] Scenario 7 — YouTube Shorts posting (see below)
- [ ] Scenario 6 — auto-approve daily post (only once you trust the output)
- [ ] Scenario 4 — analytics push (when you have analytics)

This turns your dashboard from "I click buttons" into "it runs itself":
Fiverr orders auto-update revenue, posts go out daily, customer emails get
auto-replies. You have **no Make.com account yet** — start at Step 0.

---

## Key facts you'll need (copy these)

- **Your dashboard base URL:**
  `https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space`
- **Webhook secret header** (for metric pushes): header name `X-Webhook-Secret`,
  value = your `TITAN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (already set in your Space secrets).
- All requests are **HTTP POST** with `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Endpoints Make.com will call
| Purpose | Method + URL | Body (JSON) | Needs secret header? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Log a real order | `POST /api/revenue/log` | `{"amount":10,"source":"fiverr","note":"AI resume gig"}` | No |
| Push metrics | `POST /api/metrics/bulk` | `{"metrics":{"cm_traffic":120},"source":"make"}` | Yes |
| Draft a DM reply | `POST /api/inbox/auto-reply` | `{"message":"...","platform":"fiverr","lang":"en"}` | No |
| Schedule a post | `POST /api/posts` | `{"content":"...","channels":["linkedin"]}` | No |

## Step 0 — Create your Make.com account (2 min)
1. Go to **make.com** → **Get started free**.
2. Sign up with Google (`rathoreabdullah816@gmail.com`) — easiest.
3. Pick the **Free** plan (1,000 operations/month — plenty to start).
4. You land on the dashboard. Left menu → **Scenarios** is where everything lives.

> A "scenario" = one automation. You'll build 4. Each is a chain of **modules**
> (boxes). The first box is a **trigger** (when X happens), the rest are **actions**.

---

## Scenario 1 — Fiverr order email → auto-update revenue ⭐ (do this first)

**Goal:** when Fiverr emails "You received an order!", your dashboard's Total
Revenue goes up automatically.

1. **Scenarios → Create a new scenario.**
2. Click the big **+** → search **Gmail** → choose **Watch emails**.
3. Click **Create a connection** → sign in with your Gmail → **Allow**.
4. Configure the trigger:
   - Folder: **INBOX**
   - Filter: **Subject contains** → `order` (or `You received an order`)
   - Sender: `do-not-reply@fiverr.com` (optional, more precise)
   - Max results: 1
5. Click **+** to add the next module → search **HTTP** → **Make a request**.
   - URL: `https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space/api/revenue/log`
   - Method: **POST**
   - Headers: add one → name `Content-Type`, value `application/json`
   - Body type: **Raw** → Content type **JSON (application/json)**
   - Request content:
     ```json
     { "amount": 10, "source": "fiverr", "note": "Fiverr order" }
     ```
   - (Advanced later: parse the real amount from the email body instead of 10.)
6. Bottom-left **Run once** to test, then toggle the scenario **ON** and set
   the schedule to every **15 minutes**.

✅ Now every Fiverr order email bumps your real revenue with zero clicks.

## Scenario 2 — Auto-post to your socials daily

**Goal:** post about Career Mind AI / your Fiverr gig automatically each morning.

### First, connect your social accounts (one-time)
- **Facebook + Instagram:** make Instagram a **Business/Creator** account, create a
  **Facebook Page**, link them (FB Page → Settings → Linked accounts → Instagram).
- **LinkedIn / Pinterest:** you just authorize them inside Make when you add the module.

### Build it
1. **Create a new scenario.**
2. First module → **Schedule** → every day at **09:00**.
3. Add module → **HTTP → Make a request** (pull a fresh AI-written post):
   - URL: `https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space/api/posts`
   - Method: POST, header `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body:
     ```json
     { "content": "🚀 Career Mind AI — free AI career guidance for students. Try it: <your link>", "channels": ["linkedin"] }
     ```
   - (Or hard-code your own caption here.)
4. Add module → **LinkedIn → Create a post** (or **Instagram for Business → Create a Photo Post**, or **Pinterest → Create a Pin**).
   - Connect the account → map the post text → add your gig/website link.
5. **Run once**, then turn **ON**.

> Tip: for images, add a **Canva** or **Google Drive** module before the social
> module to attach a daily image, or use a fixed image URL.

---

## Scenario 3 — Customer-care auto-reply (Gmail)

**Goal:** incoming customer email → AI drafts a warm reply → sent (or saved as draft).

1. **Create a new scenario.**
2. **Gmail → Watch emails** (INBOX; optionally filter by a label like `support`).
3. **HTTP → Make a request** (get the AI reply):
   - URL: `https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space/api/inbox/auto-reply`
   - POST, `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body (map the email text into `message`):
     ```json
     { "message": "{{the email body from step 2}}", "platform": "email", "lang": "en" }
     ```
4. **Gmail → Create a draft** (SAFE) **or Send an email** (full auto).
   - To: the original sender · Body: map `reply` from step 3.
   - **Start with Create a draft** so you approve before sending. Switch to
     **Send** once you trust it.
5. **Run once**, then **ON**.

> Honest note: keep Fiverr buyer replies as **drafts you approve** — Fiverr's
> rules forbid bots auto-messaging buyers, and full-auto can get you banned.

---

## Scenario 4 — Push real analytics (optional, later)

If you wire Google Analytics / Career Mind stats into Make, send them to your
dashboard:
- **HTTP → Make a request** → `POST /api/metrics/bulk`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json` **and** `X-Webhook-Secret: <your TITAN_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
- Body: `{ "metrics": { "cm_traffic": 120, "cm_signups": 4 }, "source": "make" }`

---

## Scenario 5 — Channel stats → light up the HUD sidebar ⭐ (new)

**Goal:** the left sidebar shows live numbers for Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest,
LinkedIn, Upwork, and Gmail. Each tile says **connect** until you push its
number; the moment Make sends it, the tile flips to **connected** with the count.

**The exact metric keys the sidebar reads:**

| Channel | Metric key | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram | `instagram_followers` | followers |
| Facebook | `facebook_followers` | Page followers |
| Pinterest | `pinterest_followers` | followers |
| LinkedIn | `linkedin_followers` | connections / followers |
| Upwork | `upwork_invites` | open invites |
| Gmail | `gmail_unread` | unread count |

### Build it
1. **Create a new scenario.** First module → **Schedule** → every **1 hour**.
2. Pull each number with the platform's own Make module (e.g. **Instagram for
   Business → Get account insights**, **Facebook Pages**, **LinkedIn**,
   **Gmail → Search emails** with `is:unread` and read the count). No native
   module for a platform? Keep the numbers in a **Google Sheet** and read that.
3. End with **HTTP → Make a request**:
   - URL: `https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space/api/metrics/bulk`
   - Method: **POST**
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json` **and**
     `X-Webhook-Secret: <your TITAN_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
   - Body (map the real values in):
     ```json
     {
       "metrics": {
         "instagram_followers": 2143,
         "facebook_followers": 840,
         "pinterest_followers": 512,
         "linkedin_followers": 1300,
         "upwork_invites": 2,
         "gmail_unread": 5
       },
       "source": "make"
     }
     ```
4. **Run once** → check the dashboard sidebar shows the numbers → turn **ON**.

> You don't need all six at once. Push whichever you have; the rest stay on
> **connect** until you wire them.

---

## Scenario 6 — Auto-approve the daily post (optional, full auto)

The dashboard's **Next Post** card already generates a caption + free AI image.
To post it without clicking Approve yourself:
1. **Schedule** → every day at **09:00**.
2. **HTTP → Make a request** → `GET /api/content/daily` → returns `caption` +
   `image_url`.
3. Feed those into your **LinkedIn / Instagram / Pinterest** module from
   Scenario 2 (caption → text, `image_url` → image).

> Keep clicking **Approve & schedule** in the dashboard yourself until you trust
> the output — then switch this on for hands-off posting.

---

## Scenario 7 — YouTube Shorts, semi-auto (honest version)

**What Titan can and can't do:** Titan generates titles, descriptions, captions,
and thumbnail images for free — but it CANNOT render video files on the free
tier (real video generation needs paid GPU services). The honest $0 pipeline:
you record short screen clips (the Titan boot sequence and AI City fly-through
are perfect Shorts material), and Make.com auto-publishes them with
Titan-written metadata.

1. Make a Google Drive folder `titan-shorts`. Drop any vertical screen
   recording (15–45s) in it.
2. **Create scenario:** trigger **Google Drive → Watch files** on that folder.
3. Add **HTTP → Make a request**:
   - `GET https://careermind2026-project-titan-omega.hf.space/api/content/daily?target=auto`
   - Returns `caption` (use as the video description) + `link`.
4. Add **YouTube → Upload a video**: map the Drive file, title = first line of
   the caption + `#Shorts`, description = full caption.
5. **Run once** with a test clip, then turn ON.

> Money truth: YouTube pays only after 1,000 subscribers + 4,000 watch-hours
> (or 10M Shorts views in 90 days). Post consistently; treat early Shorts as
> marketing for Career Mind/Fiverr (link in description), not as direct income.

## Order to do it in
1. **Scenario 1** (revenue) — instant value, lowest risk.
2. **Scenario 3** as **drafts** (customer care).
3. **Scenario 5** (channel stats) — lights up your new HUD sidebar.
4. **Scenario 2** (social posting) once your IG/FB/LinkedIn are connected.
5. **Scenario 4 / 6** when you have analytics / trust auto-posting.

## Safety rules
- Never put passwords/keys in the post body — only the `X-Webhook-Secret` header.
- Start every "send"/"post" scenario in **draft/manual** mode, watch it once,
  then switch to auto.
- Free plan = 1,000 ops/month. Each scenario run uses a few ops — fine to start.
