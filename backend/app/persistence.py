"""Lightweight JSON persistence for the running empire state.

Hugging Face Spaces (free tier) have an ephemeral filesystem: a writable path
survives process restarts / sleep-wake but is wiped on a fresh rebuild. We save
the real numbers that matter — revenue metrics and the order ledger — to a JSON
file so the dashboard remembers earnings across restarts.

Everything is best-effort and wrapped in try/except: persistence must never
crash the app. To make data permanent across rebuilds, mount HF persistent
storage at /data (or point TITAN_STATE_FILE at a mounted volume / database).
