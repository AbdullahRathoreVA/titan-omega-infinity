"""Lightweight login for the deployed dashboard.

Credentials are read from environment variables at deploy time — they are NEVER
hardcoded in the repo (a password committed to git is a public password). Set
``TITAN_USERNAME`` and ``TITAN_PASSWORD`` on your host; until you do, a clearly
labelled demo login is used.

Auth is only enforced when ``TITAN_REQUIRE_AUTH=1`` (you set this on the public
deploy). Locally it's off, so the dashboard opens with no friction.

This is a single-operator gate, not a multi-tenant identity system — good enough
to keep your public URL private, and honest about what it is.
