"""Executive Intelligence Core — the AI CEO.

This is the brain that sits above the Digital Employee Network. It understands the
empire's state, allocates priorities, generates daily/weekly/monthly plans,
forecasts revenue and traffic, and routes natural-language commands to the right
division and agent.

The reasoning here is deterministic and rule-based so the foundation runs with no
external model dependency. The architecture is built so a Claude/Gemini/OpenAI
planner can be dropped in behind :func:`generate_plan` and :func:`route_command`
without changing callers (see README → "Wiring real models").
