"""Self-Evolution Engine.

Closes the feedback loop: when an execution completes successfully or is
reverted/failed, this engine nudges the opportunity scoring weights so future
scores reflect real-world results rather than hand-tuned priors.

Weights live in ``STORE.metrics`` under ``weight_*`` keys so the dashboard and
Opportunity Engine can read them without import cycles. All adjustments are
small and bounded to keep scoring stable over time.
