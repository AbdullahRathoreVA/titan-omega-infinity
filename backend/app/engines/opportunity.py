"""Global Opportunity Engine.

Continuously surfaces growth opportunities — new niches, products, markets,
revenue streams, partnerships and automations — and scores each on a common
rubric so the Executive Core can prioritize objectively.

Priority is a transparent composite: reward (expected revenue) is discounted by
difficulty, risk and time-to-value. The formula is deliberately simple and
auditable rather than a black box.
