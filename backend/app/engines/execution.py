"""Autonomous Execution Layer.

The platform does not stop at analysis: where permitted, agents act. This layer
turns an intent (often an opportunity) into a tracked, **logged, verified and
reversible** action. Agents with ``SUGGEST`` autonomy produce actions that wait
for human approval; ``EXECUTE``/``AUTONOMOUS`` agents run within guardrails.

Every state transition appends to the action's audit log so the command center
can show exactly what happened and so any action can be reverted.

Completed and reverted actions feed their outcomes back to the Self-Evolution
Engine so opportunity scoring weights are tuned by real-world results.
