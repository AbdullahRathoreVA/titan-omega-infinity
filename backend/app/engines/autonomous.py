"""Autonomous Growth Engine — real 24/7 research + a marketing "war room".

Three honest capabilities, all degrade gracefully (never raise, never fake):

* ``growth_cycle`` — live web + news research for earning opportunities,
  competitors, and SEO keywords, synthesised by the LLM. Runs on the heartbeat.
* ``marketing_debate`` — a team of marketing agents each pitch, then a head
  picks/combines and gives an executable plan. Real LLM multi-agent.
* ``seo_report`` — analyses the live ranking landscape for a keyword and returns
  a prioritised action list. Honest: it never promises a guaranteed #1.

With no ``TAVILY_API_KEY`` the web search returns [] and we fall back to an LLM
brainstorm; with no LLM key the text falls back to a clear "set a key" note.
